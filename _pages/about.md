I'm a software architect at [Atos Unify](https://unify.com/en/). More about my professional life on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christiangarbin/). Over the years, with the help of my colleagues, we were granted
[a few patents](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q1ZmDvYAAAAJ&hl=en).

In December of 2020 I completed a Computer Science master's degree at [Florida Atlantic University](https://www.fau.edu/),
focusing on machine learning. The thesis is available [here](https://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A64688).

I'm now a Ph.D. candidate, focusing on machine learning, continuing the work I did for the master's degree. My master's and Ph.D. projects are [on GitHub](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin).

### Publications from the master's and Ph.D. work

- [Master's thesis](https://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A64688).
- Code for assignments, research projects, and blog posts is [on GitHub](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin).

Papers and articles where I'm the main author:

- [Assessing Methods and Tools to Improve Reporting, Increase Transparency, and Reduce Failures in Machine Learning Applications in Health Care](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryai.210127), on the RSNA Radiology:Artificial Intelligence journal (free version available on the [NIH Library of Medicine site](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8980932/)). This article is based on the [master's thesis](https://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A64688).
- [Dataset datasheet for CheXpert](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03020), in collaboration with the [Stanford CheXpert team](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/).
- [Dropout vs. batch normalization](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-019-08453-9). The free version of the paper is [available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PyRUgSXqpl_OvJkWrR4HCWLDaEexzWd9/view) and the code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin/cap6619-deep-learning-term-project).

Papers and articles where I'm a collaborator:

- [On the use of colormaps in the context of post-hoc explainable AI methods](https://cdn.ymaws.com/siim.org/resource/resmgr/siim2022/documents/abstract/2009/2009_-_marques,___on_the_use.pdf), an [abstract session in SIIM 2002](https://siim.org/page/22m_2009).
- IEEE ICMLA data science tutorial [notebooks](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin/ieee-icmla-2019-data-science-tutorial), the practical part of [Dr. Marques'](https://www.ogemarques.com/) [The Data Science landscape: foundations, tools, and practical applications](https://www.icmla-conference.org/icmla19/links/tutorialAM.htm) session.

### Older things

I used to be more active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/336802/christian-garbin). Nowadays I help a bit with questions and answers moderation.

Earlier I wrote a few pieces on programming topics on [Blogger](https://christiangarbin.blogspot.com/). I switched to GitHub Pages (this blog) to simplify my workflows because most of my work is already on GitHub.
