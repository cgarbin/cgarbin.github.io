I'm a software engineer at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/). More about my professional life on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christiangarbin/).

In December of 2020 I completed a Computer Science master's degree at [Florida Atlantic University](https://www.fau.edu/),
focusing on machine learning. The thesis is available [here](https://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A64688). I'm now a Ph.D. candidate, focusing on machine learning, continuing the work I did for the master's degree. My master's and Ph.D. projects are [on GitHub](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin).

### Publications

- [Master's thesis](https://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A64688).
- Code for assignments, research projects, and blog posts are [on GitHub](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin).

Papers and articles where I'm the main author:

- [Machine learning for predicting opioid use disorder from healthcare data, a systematic review](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107573). The accepted manuscript is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JqsCfO_sq8fMwOeLe2bQrzTto0CHN1Vd/view?usp=share_link) (free to access).

### Older things

I used to be more active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/336802/christian-garbin). Nowadays I help a bit with questions and answers moderation.

Earlier I wrote a few pieces on programming topics on [Blogger](https://christiangarbin.blogspot.com/). I switched to GitHub Pages (this blog) to simplify my workflows because most of my work is already on GitHub.
